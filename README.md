# ViperVision
I began writing this code when I learned to loop in PHP. Then after learning forms, and validations, I got an idea, why not build a website for introverts like myself? The year was 2016 when I first got "Hello World" from PHP. I then learned slowly because I had no active internet connection. I made a simple social site-like website at that time. However, I got interested in AI later and started learning Python.
